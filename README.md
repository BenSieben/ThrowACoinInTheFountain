Throw a Coin in the Fountain Website


Uses PHP, FPDF, and Stripe to create a website which can generate
simple PDF files based on the user's name and customization options
after the user pays a set  amount of money via Stripe (uses Stripe test keys, 
so no real money needed; just use a test card number like 4242424242424242)


This project uses Composer. It must be installed, and then using
"composer install" in command line in root
directory of project should create the necessary files to
get the project in a working state


I chose to use Simplified Chinese as a second language of the website, but 
I am not fluent in Chinese so the text was just translated in Google 
Translate (Also, not everything is translated). Apologies for any bad
translations


Also, note that fountain images are generated from website usage, both for the temporary
fountain on the landing page and permanent fountains to place in wish PDFs
inside the src/resources/ and src/resources/fountains/ directories
